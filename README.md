Application Problem Definition: Analyzing dialogues between speakers of different ages.


In the context of this project: Is the application problem focused on analyzing dialogues between speakers of different ages. The key tasks and insights are as follows:

**Task 1: Description of Data and Methods:**
- Preprocessing: The data required essential preprocessing steps, such as tokenization and vectorization, to prepare it for analysis. Tokenization splits the text into tokens (words, phrases, or sentences), while vectorization converts text data into numerical representations.
- Feature Extraction and Analysis: Clustering algorithms, word frequency analysis, sentence length analysis, and sentiment analysis were used to gain insights into the data before modeling.
- Deep Learning Approaches: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were identified as a common deep learning approach for textual data analysis, with a discussion of trade-offs regarding training time and efficiency.

**Task 2: Investigate, Model, and Report on Insights from Friend's Dialogue Data:**
- Age Distribution Analysis: The dataset's age distribution was analyzed, revealing variations across different age ranges and highlighting the age-related linguistic phenomena or preferences.
- Language Origin: The dataset's linguistic origin was examined, indicating the dominance of English speakers.
- Common Words: The most frequently used words among the speakers were identified, offering insights into unique language patterns.

**Task 3: Age Group and Dialogue Summary:**
- Analysis of Average Utterance Length: The average utterance length was examined across different age groups, revealing variations in communication patterns.
- Speaker Distribution: The number of speakers across different age ranges was visualized, showing a focus on younger demographics.
- First Language: The distribution of speakers' first languages was analyzed, with English being the majority.

**Tasks 4, 5, and 6: Machine Learning Modeling:**
- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression was applied to predict age ranges from text data, achieving an accuracy of 38%.
- Feature Engineering: Text data was transformed into token counts using vectorization techniques.
- Random Forest Classifier: A random forest classifier significantly outperformed logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 97.2%, with high precision for specific age ranges.

Overall, the analysis provided valuable insights into the dialogue data, including language patterns, age-related variations, and the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting age ranges based on text data. The report emphasized the importance of preprocessing, feature engineering, and appropriate model selection for text data analysis. Various visualizations and statistics were used to convey the findings effectively. References to relevant sources were provided for further exploration.
